///////////////////////////////

Pseudo code

- plan on using CSS grid to get the layout
- button to get info (have button light up when hover and flash when activated)
- search bar
- will need to get img of houses, wand, and potion flask, to be pulled/placed based on the data searched
- maybe add some search filters to get by house, type of spell, or difficult of potion?
- figure out an auto complete function for search?
- maybe add a button to get a random character or spell? Since their JSON file has IDs with random characters, will need to figure out a way to get a random result from array.
- Will need to figure out a way to get loose match to character - currently Harry Potter = Harry James Potter -> want to be Harry Potter
- Would like to add 'magic' effect to cursor where there is a glittery trail or something
- have background image be school at night or some other fun background - not plain solid color 
- want soft edges on container borders
